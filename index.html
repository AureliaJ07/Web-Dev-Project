        <div>
          <p>I have always enjoyed working with computers. Whenever a new program was introduced at work, I was eager to explore and master it. Over time, my curiosity evolved into a genuine passion for web development. Through my role at Walmart, I completed online courses covering topics from GitHub to UX/UI, which greatly expanded my knowledge. These past few months have been transformative, as I’ve immersed myself in courses aligned with web development. The more I learn, the more inspired I am to venture further into web and software development. One of my biggest challenges was learning JavaScript, but with dedication, it’s become much more approachable—and I’m confident I’ll master it soon. I’m also excited to explore other programming languages to broaden my skill set.</p>
          <p>My goal is to contribute to a company where we develop software or programs that make a global impact. The idea of creating something that could be used by millions and improve their lives is truly motivating. I have several ideas I’d love to bring to life, but I believe in taking things one step at a time and building a strong foundation for future success.</p>
